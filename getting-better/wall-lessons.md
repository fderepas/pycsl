# wall-lessons.md — resolved-wall ledger (self-tcb-reduction driver)

Each entry: a wall the driver RESOLVED as CERTIFIED-BOUNDARY / DEFERRED (measured, not a cheap win), with the
L-input that revealed it. BROKEN walls are in the git log (conversions).

## 2026-07-20 driver run (count 1030 → 1028; 2 conversions + these walls)

### BROKEN (converted)
- `_extract_generic_arg_names` (List[str] returns) — commit 3f38bd78. Fix: `needs_return_seq_str` on `return_value_type=="string"`.
- `_is_null_byte_lit` (ArrayLit of Number 0) — commit dc493048. Added faithful `num_of` emit_ir Number-value projector.

### CERTIFIED-BOUNDARY / DEFERRED walls (measured; each needs an authorize-first build)
- **`_symtype_to_whyml` / Optional[str]-PARAM comparison** — `symtype == "str"` on an `Optional[str]` param int-HASHES
  the literal (`symtype = 1917410062`, union-vs-int typecheck FAIL). Item #5 covered Optional LOCALS, NOT param
  comparison. Fix = MODELLING change: option-unwrap the comparison (`match symtype with Arm_1_0 s -> str_eq_op s "str"
  | Arm_1_None -> false`) + a C8 union-narrowing recognizer treating string-literal equality as a valid guard.
  Byte-diff-RISKY (shared comparison lowering) → authorize-first, FLAGGED not auto-dispatched. Re-confirmed twice.
- **`_val_is_bool`** — conversion itself PROVES faithfully, but ARCHITECTURAL Gate-5 wall: the live method moved
  `statements.py`→`types.py` (already converted there via the record path), so the `statements.py` mirror copy is an
  ORPHAN cross-mixin resolution stub — `mirror-check` flags "un-trusted mirror def not in source" once converted.
  Non-convertible without a mirror/live file-realignment (out of the loop's scope).
- **`_union_c8_recognized_guard`** — top-level reads go faithful with `test:"ExprIR"`, but `for side in
  (test.get("left"), test.get("right"))` needs literal-tuple-unroll + `side.get(...)`/`args[0]` need
  list-subscript-into-emit_ir; `func=="isinstance"` int-hashes. Multi-feature build.
- **Generic `for v in node.values(): walk(v)` tree-walkers** (7+ in `core_ir_semantic.py`: `_contains_result`,
  `_body_has_raise`, `_body_has_return`, `_lemma_returns_value`, …) — the untyped-IR-nested-dict `.values()`
  reflection wall. Retired only by a certified generic IR-tree FOLD over the pyast/ExprIR ADT. Highest-count family.
- **`_collect_union_arms`** (§8c) — 5-piece: List[emit_ir] returns + worklist tree-size-SUM termination variant.
- **`_collect_typevar_registry`** (§8d) — Dict[str,Dict[str,Any]]: variable-valued dict-literal DROP + Any int-erase.
- **Two live-tool faithfulness BUGS** (`faithfulness-bugs-found.md`): dict-literal-drop (empty map, false-theorem
  generator) + negative-slice-empty (`s[1:-1]`→`""`). Verified fixes exist but can't co-land (mirror can't re-prove
  the fixed body — the emit_ir sub-node value model). Common root with the collectors.

### The single highest-leverage unlock
The **emit_ir-typed sub-node value model** (tool-method `.get("expr")`/`.get("left")` reads typed `emit_ir` not
`int`) is the common root of: both faithfulness bugs, `_union_c8_recognized_guard`, the collectors, and the
`.values()` walkers. Closing it (a certified generic IR-tree read/fold) is the highest-leverage multi-session build.

### Environment note
The monolithic whole-file proof WEDGES on driver-verifier RE-RUNS (0 VCs or post-VC finalization hang, 0% CPU) while
the executor agents' runs discharge cleanly — treat an agent's clean SUCCESS + independent byte-diff-0 + mutation-test
+ count + fidelity + allowlist as the verdict when a re-run wedges (document it).

## 2026-07-20 (12h run) — proof-viable small-build frontier EXHAUSTED
After +2 conversions (`_body_has_return` stmt-catamorphism, `_build_method_return_annotation_map` flat-strdict) +
Bug 1 soundness fix, a measure-before-build drain returned `no_small_build_remaining`. Findings:
- **STRUCTURAL: per-file mirror-sync blocks the "duplicate-stub" family.** A stub `\trusted` in file A whose live
  method lives (and is converted) in file B CANNOT be converted in A — `self-annotate-mirror-check.sh` rejects
  "un-trusted mirror def not in source". Validated on `_array_coerce_arg` (emitted faithfully + passed mutation,
  but rejected — lives in expressions.py, stub in statements.py). Invalidates `_field_label`/`_val_is_bool`/
  `_bool_ir_to_int_wrap`/`_str_operand_to_int`/`_array_coerce_arg`/… as convertible-where-stubbed.
- **PROOF-ENV: `core_ir_semantic.py` whole-file proofs WEDGE why3** (0% CPU hang) on heavy combined theory (stmt
  catamorphism + a ~60-arm expr fold). `_body_has_return` (lighter) proved; adding the expr fold wedged. Blocks the
  tree-walk expr-fold family (`_contains_result` built+evidenced but reverted; patch banked).
- Cheapest genuine remaining (all multi-piece): setfold method-call-guard + pyval-domain predicate emission
  (`_collect_dict_var_assigns`/`_collect_variant_var_assigns`); Dict[str,Dict[str,str]] self-field record-metadata
  value model (`_callable_tag_to_whyml`/`_is_emit_ir_expr`); keyword-node modeling + nested-map (`_collect_typevar_registry`).

## 2026-07-20 (12h run) — SINGLE-BUILD frontier EXHAUSTED after +5 conversions
Landed this run (1027→1022): `_body_has_return` (stmt catamorphism), `_build_method_return_annotation_map`
(flat-strdict), `_collect_dict_var_assigns` (setfold method-call-guard), `_collect_variant_var_assigns` (setfold
ctor-membership+prefix), `_callable_tag_to_whyml` (opaque-selfmap 2-level reader) + Bug 1 soundness fix. Then the
reader/recogniser veins EXHAUSTED:
- opaque-selfmap reader's clean frontier is done — the only remaining consumers (`_is_emit_ir_expr`,
  `_handle_subscript`) are GIANTS behind the emit-ir helper cascade (`_emit_ir_args_recv_ir`/`_mktuple_elts_recv_ir`/
  `_is_pyast_stmt_emit_ir_read` + `_EMIT_IR_*` constants, all absent from the mirror) — a NET-MARKER-POSITIVE
  giants-front build (port would ADD ≥3 stubs to remove 1), NOT a single-reader win. And their 3-level read is a
  `.get()` chain with a computed key (no bound-alias subscript to match).
- setfold clean shapes done; remaining Set[str] collectors have heavy self-dict-of-dict / nested-def closures.
**Remaining reachable = deliberate MULTI-SESSION builds only:** (a) the emit-ir helper substrate + giants front
(net-positive per giant_conversion_net_positive, but a 77-helper-DAG multi-session build); (b) core_ir_semantic
proof-env resolution (why3 wedge; unblocks the tree-walk expr-fold family, `_contains_result` patch banked);
(c) keyword-node modeling + nested-Dict[str,Dict] return (`_collect_typevar_registry`); (d) `List[emit_ir]`
returns + worklist termination (`_collect_union_arms`). No clean single-build +1 remains.

## 2026-07-20 (12h run) — giants emit-ir substrate = CERTIFIED-BOUNDARY (heterogeneous Dict[str,Any] value model)
User-authorized the giants substrate build for `_is_emit_ir_expr`. Spike-by-building (bottom-up, net-count gate):
- helper `_emit_ir_args_recv_ir` WALLS HARD — reads `arg_ir` HETEROGENEOUSLY in one body (`.get("type")`→string,
  `.get("values")`→array, `[0]`→node) → no single WhyML type; emit fails L3-tc (`array int` vs `int`, expressions.mlw:711).
  Exactly the `generic-dict-str-and.md` Dict[str,Any] wall (F-B1 NO-GO). Needs the FULL heterogeneous `pyval` value
  model, not a bounded reader.
- dispatcher `_is_emit_ir_expr` INDEPENDENTLY walls — `getattr(self,"_current_self_type",None) in getattr(self,
  "_mutable_state_classes",set())` self-scalar getattr-default reflection (the same pattern that re-trusted
  `_handle_fstring_expr`/`_handle_ifexpr_expr`, expressions.py:788/902).
- NET: helper trusted (+1) + dispatcher (−1) = 0, never < 1022 → net-marker-positive → ABORTED, reverted.
**The giants front (and the Dict-of-Dict collector value-model layer) share ONE research-grade root: the faithful
heterogeneous `Dict[str,Any]`/`pyval` value model + its certificate.** That is a dedicated multi-session RESEARCH
build (no-more-int "long-term EXTREME RIGOR"), not a driver-loop single/multi-piece build. Leaving these giants
`\trusted` is an ASSUMPTION, not a soundness hole. FRONTIER AT RESEARCH-GRADE FLOOR for the driver loop.

## 2026-07-20 (10h run) — the MASKED-WHOLE-FILE-BLOCKER vein (NEW; +4 conv + 4 byte-inert emitter fixes)
KEY DISCOVERY: the prior run's `no_cheap_remaining` was MASKING cheap stubs. A stub can be trivial yet
ungateable because ANOTHER stub's emitted signature breaks the WHOLE FILE's whole-file proof (the gate is
whole-file, §10.10). The prior loop only PROBED conversions; it never FIXED the emitter, so it couldn't see
past the blocker. Fixing the byte-inert emitter bug unblocks the file's gate -> its cheap stubs convert.
Detect: sweep `for f in mirror/*.py; do pycsl $f --no-proof | grep -q 'L3-tc ✓' || echo FAIL; done`.
FIVE emitter bugs found; FOUR fixed byte-inert (corpus diff 0, ledger 3), each unblocking a file/class:
1. `option (seq string)` un-parenthesized (functions.py _compute_return_type) -> `option (seq τ)` parens guard
   (mirrors _emit_dict_map_type). Unblocked Module6_WhyMLTranspiler.py -> +1 (_wrap_with_no_exception_assert).
2. undeclared-union `Return_` exception (preamble.py _emit_union_return_exceptions): an IMPORTED trusted-stub
   fn's synthesized `_union_*` type_decl isn't merged into the emitting module -> dangling unbound type. FIX:
   skip Return_ for unions not in declared_types. Unblocked audit_proof/pycsl/__init__ typecheck.
3. string-faithful lowering was gated behind @mutable_state; un-gate on declared-`string` return (ternary
   _handle_ifexpr_expr) + genuinely-string slice base (_collect_str_call_result_locals) -> +2 (BoolLit.pp,
   _indent_width) +1 sibling (_sanitize_type_name). Highest-leverage: a real no-more-int capability.
4. `self__py_expr_to_ir_1` unbound (abstract_ops.py): stmt_ir-bespoke handlers emit raw dispatcher refs that
   only get an abstract `val` when a non-stub method calls them; in an IMPORTED emitter class all methods are
   bodyless -> unbound. FIX: _register_referenced_self_dispatch_vals scans out + registers the missing vals.
   Unblocked ir_resolve/frontend.__init__ typecheck (but those stubs are dependency-stub-walled / proof-times-out).
VEIN NOW EXHAUSTED for cheap wins: unblocked files' remaining stubs are all value-model-walled (@property
vacuous, Set[str]-membership int-hash, heterogeneous-dict, collection option-int, whole-file-proof-timeout).
LESSON: masked blockers CHAIN (fix one -> next surfaces) and BOTTOM OUT at the value model. But the vein is
REAL and was invisible to the probe-only base loop — always sweep whole-file-typecheck FIRST at a claimed floor.
The 5th blocker (stmt_control_flow `{"pattern":str,"ctor":var,"captures":[list]}`) = the heterogeneous
Dict[str,Any] value-model wall = CERTIFIED-BOUNDARY (research build, now escalated: pyval-value-model-wall.md).
Also: Set[str]/frozenset membership int-hashes the string (str_hash_op) — a SEPARATE collection value-model
wall from the ternary/slice/len string capability; candidates are in the ledger file (off-limits) or compound-blocked.

## 2026-07-21 (10h run #2) — the "reflection wall" is MODELLABLE + the fixture-witness deadlock-break
Two campaign-level lessons from converting `_collect_final_registry` + `_collect_type_params` (count 1015→1013)
via the self-field-append subsystem (K1) + the tparam reflection-node ADT (L1) + the pyval value-model recognizers (L4a):

1. **AST reflection is a node-kind ADT, NOT an unmodellable wall.** `type(tp).__name__` / `isinstance(node, ast.X)` /
   `getattr(node, attr)` / `node.bases` over a Python AST node lower FAITHFULLY to a node-kind discriminant + typed
   projectors — the pyast_stmt/emit_ir precedent extended to new node kinds. L1 built the `tparam` node ADT
   (`tp_kind_of`/`tp_name`/`tp_bound`, Phase2h cert axiom-free); 7b built ClassDef-**bases** reflection
   (`is_classdef_of`/`bases_of`/`is_sub`/`svalue_of` + a faithful class-string-set-constant membership
   `str_eq_op (name_of (svalue_of b)) "Generic"`). Prior runs mis-classified `type().__name__` as the dropped
   generic reflection — it is a KIND DISCRIMINANT over PEP-695 nodes. Each new node kind = a bounded ADT-emission
   build (L1-scale); the collectors need SEVERAL (tparam, bases, ast.walk, Subscript, multi-arg call.args).

2. **The session-scale co-land deadlock breaks via the FIXTURE-WITNESS pattern.** A Module5 collector needs ~7
   value-model recognizers co-landed AT ONCE (each converts 0 alone → non-vacuity forbids committing a subset →
   they kept getting spike-proven-then-REVERTED across K4/K6/K7). FIX: commit the SHARED recognizers as infra with a
   reference FIXTURE as the non-vacuity witness (the L1/pyval-I1 precedent — an ADT/recognizer + a fixture that
   exercises it commits WITHOUT a stub conversion). L4a committed the 5 pyval recognizers (local seq-pyval / map-pyval
   field / chained .get / or-default / pyval return) + fixture 0922; L4b then only needed the node-reflection (7a/7b)
   + the conversion. This turns an all-or-nothing session-scale build into committable increments.

3. **Self-field .append facade (Bug 3):** `self._field.append(x)` emitted a shadow-local Array.make never written back.
   FIX (K1): gate the faithful `self.<f> <- Seq.snoc (old self.<f>) (pyval)` write-back on the seq-pyval field case →
   byte-inert (homogeneous array-int corpus appends unchanged). The M1 blast fear was UNFOUNDED (the facade was in no
   green corpus proof — fable-verified).

## 2026-07-21 (10h run #3) — value-model capability PLATEAU (3 infra, 0 conversions)
Run #3 built THREE committed value-model capabilities (all byte-inert, axiom-free, fixture-witnessed, count-neutral)
but converted ZERO stubs — the frontier is session-scale everywhere:
- Set[str] value model (f375baa9, set.SetApp executable + Fset spec, fixture 0923).
- const-reflection (f3888a7f, is_constant/is_num_or_float/num_of over existing emit_ir leaves, fixture 0924).
- List[RecordType] class-field emission (614fd814, `self.f: List[<rec>]`→`array <rec>`, fixture 0925).
Both redirect targets bottomed out at SESSION-SCALE emitter retrofits:
- pure_ast parser primitives (highest-count file, 262 stubs): CERTIFIED-BOUNDARY — converting even `cur` needs
  `@mutable_state` on the mirror `_Parser` = a +283-line stateful-mirror retrofit (flips the global emit_ir-theory
  gate + file-wide field-qualification); field-projecting primitives additionally wall on `*vals` varargs-membership.
- _collect_class_fields: tuple-return-pyval (R7, proven bounded) + annotation-reflection helpers (type().__name__/
  getattr on emit_ir annotation nodes) + frozenset-tuple membership — receding conjunction.
LESSON: the value-model capability-building has out-run its conversion consumers. The remaining ~1013 stubs are
dominated by stubs needing SESSION-SCALE emitter subsystems, NOT incremental recognizers. The highest-count unlock
candidates: (1) the @mutable_state stateful-MIRROR retrofit (unblocks the parser + stateful-class stubs, but +283
lines/file, risky, parser payoff capped ~3 by varargs); (2) the recursive `.values()`/`_walk_dicts` dict-generic
tree-walker model (the frontier-exhaustion-map's "85 Dict[str,Any] walkers" dominant hard class — potentially
high-count); (3) accept the plateau (extensive infra banked for a future co-land). Count 1013 held.

## 2026-07-21/22 (run #4) — the plateau was a SURVEY ARTIFACT; W8 token-cursor opened
### (a) TWO SELF-INFLICTED REGRESSIONS + a new MANDATORY gate
Run #3's shared-lowering commits (Tier-5 `pyval` ADT, Set[str]/StrSet) passed corpus byte-diff-0, their own
fixtures, AND mirror-check — while BREAKING TWO MIRROR FILES: (A) `ir_resolve.py` "Symbol PStr is already defined"
(the Tier-5 `pyval` collided with the older pydict generic-fold `pyval`; fixed by renaming Tier-5 → `hval`/`H*` —
and the fix had to include the internal `"pyval"` value-type SENTINEL, not just literal emission sites); (B)
`stmt_control_flow.py` — two CONVERTED bodies type-broken (StrSet in an int slot; nested heterogeneous dict not
pyval-gated). 41 stubs were gated behind them.
=> **MANDATORY GATE (new): any change to SHARED EMITTER LOWERING must re-run the MIRROR-WIDE L3-tc sweep**
(`for f in mirror/*.py: pycsl $f --no-proof | grep -q 'L3-tc ✓' || FAIL`) before committing. Corpus byte-diff covers
the CORPUS; mirror-check compares BODIES not emissions; a fixture only exercises the new path. The MIRROR files are
where shared-lowering changes bite. Also: **re-pin the byte-diff baseline after any M1 sanctioned reset** — it went
stale TWICE this run (after capability (i) changed 8 corpus files) and produced spurious diffs both times.

### (b) THE PLATEAU WAS A SURVEY ARTIFACT (count hygiene + the real vein)
Ledger: raw grep 1013 → 964 real function stubs (49 are docstring mentions) → **929 PORTABLE** (35 are cross-mixin
PHANTOM forward-decls whose real body lives at a sibling mixin). Census over the 929: **439 (47%) hit NO known wall**,
and **292 of those sit in THREE files behind ONE shared W8 token-cursor gate** (pure_ast 202, Module2_Parser 76,
proof2why3/parser 14). Runs #1-#3 concentrated on Module5_IREmitter + a pure_ast sub-slice and concluded
"session-scale everywhere" — that verdict was drawn from the wrong sample.

### (c) ROUND-2's W8 BOUNDARY WAS MIS-DIAGNOSED (the +283-line blast radius)
Round 2 CERTIFIED-BOUNDARY'd the token cursor because a record-typed self-field required `@mutable_state`, which
"cost +283 mlw lines". MEASURED in round 3: the record field and the emit_ir ADT theory are **fully separable** —
the +283 was the THEORY dragged in by the COARSE `@mutable_state` gate disjunct. Deferring the theory when only the
coarse disjunct fires (splice it back iff the emitted text references a symbol the theory declares — anti-drift,
conservative-safe) gives **−277 lines (303 → 26)** on the probe. Capability (i) landed (85679c71, fixture 0926) as a
clean M1 reset (8 corpus files × exactly −277/+0, all re-proved). LESSON: a "blast radius" attributed to a FEATURE
may belong to its GATE — measure the delta with the gate split before declaring the boundary.

### (d) CARVE-OUT to the fixed contract shape: PARTIAL methods take a precondition
The fixed shape is `requires True / ensures True / assigns <frame>`. `proof2why3/parser._Parser.take` steps `self.pos`
UNGUARDED (it genuinely raises IndexError past the end), so `requires True` is UNPROVABLE and the stronger class
invariant `pos < len(toks)` would be a LIE. Faithful conversion used `#@ requires self.pos < \length(self.toks)` —
the method's REAL domain. CARVE-OUT (not a licence to weaken): a precondition is permitted ONLY when it states the
method's genuine partiality; it must never be a convenience narrowing to dodge an unproved goal, and the class
invariant must not be strengthened beyond what the live code actually maintains.

### (e) run #4 FINAL — W8 token-cursor wall BROKEN: 19 conversions (1013→994), 7 capabilities, ledger held at 3
The wall run #3 CERTIFIED-BOUNDARY'd at "~3 primitives / +283-line blast radius" yielded 19 conversions once the
gate/feature confusion was measured away. Capability chain, each spike-gated + fixture-witnessed + byte-diff-0:
(i) low-blast-radius record-element class field [85679c71, fx 0926] → W1 cur/advance/take [dde9b2c7,e3a5e803, fx 0927]
→ (iii) self-field array-read projection [826b4f56, fx 0928; 0 conversions, but its census found the true shape]
→ (vi) concrete same-class sibling call w/ record return [5de7bec4,a0db955c, fx 0929; 0 conversions, found (vii)]
→ (vii) tail-return bool→int + idempotence guard [3079a72a] → (ii) varargs-membership `seq_mem_str` + CONCRETE token
kinds [0b72b5c6,498429b8, fx 0930-0932] → (v) Optional[<record>] union arm + (iv) negative literal index
[edbc597d..c30f4bab, fx 0933-0934].
BEYOND THE COUNT (tool honesty): 2 abstract vals ELIMINATED (`get_OP` was an unconstrained int making token-kind
disjointness inexpressible; `kwlist` membership was `contains_check(str_hash_op …)` with NO ensures anywhere);
3 pre-existing VACUOUS union variants repaired (`Arm_*_None`-only, no record arm: ir_schema, struct_format,
p2w/parser); 1 pre-existing emitter bug fixed (vii).
FACADES REFUSED (Gate C, left \trusted): `_err`/`error`/`unsupported` + all `expect_*` — they raise in Python but
model as value-returning no-ops (the model FALLS THROUGH to advance() on the failure path) and the f-string payload
is dropped (mutation ⇒ byte-identical .mlw). Needs a faithful raise-model/payload capability. A bogus `Arm_3_0 int`
arm was also caught pre-landing by re-gating (v) on the emitted record type_decl set.
RESIDUALS (measured, honest): `accept_*`'s guard `self.at_op(v)` still abstracts to `ensures true` (sound
over-approximation — proven content is invariant-preservation + frame; needs concrete NON-record sibling lowering);
contract-side `None` lowers to int 0; `Optional[<record>]` mutable LOCAL still `ref 0`; negative index in a VARIABLE
keeps the old lowering. NEXT: raise-model/payload capability (unlocks expect_*), then the ~80-100-stub bulk
(grammar helpers, precedence-climbing binop chains, comma/dot accumulators, keyword→single-clause constructors).

## 2026-07-22 (run #5) — L3-tc PASS IS A WEAK SIGNAL: 91% of typecheck-passers were facades
A bulk auto-porting probe over **284** `\trusted` stubs (≤5-stmt live bodies, then a ≤12-stmt band) across 48 mirror
files measured the two-stage yield precisely:
  **34/284 passed L3-tc — but 31 of those 34 were Gate-C FACADES on inspection of the emitted WhyML.**
Only 3 survived the anti-facade filter. => **L3-tc (and even a green whole-file proof) is NOT evidence of a real
conversion.** The MUTATION TEST + emitted-WhyML inspection is the load-bearing gate; without it this drain would have
banked 31 fake count cuts. Canonical facade shapes seen: the nested visitor `def` VANISHES leaving
`let found = Array.make 1 0; walk body; found[0]` (a constant); `isinstance_op 0 0`; string keys as int-hash
(`subscript_get !func_ir 1878939832`); an opaque single-call delegate (`(_check_1 expr)`); record fields silently
dropped on return (`(const (None: option int))`).
ALSO BANNED AS VACUOUS (emit no body and no VC at all — a count cut would be fake): `__init__` (absorbed into the
record type decl), `@property`, dunders (`__enter__`/`__exit__`), and any stub emitted as a bodyless `val`.

### Blocker census after the drain (highest multiplicity first — the next capability queue)
A. **nested `def`/closure dropped — ~21 stubs** (the inner visitor vanishes ⇒ constant result). Gates the whole
   `core_ir_semantic` collector family (`_body_has_raise`, `_body_has_diverging_construct`, `_lemma_returns_value`,
   `_lemma_calls_trusted`) + `canonical.alpha_normalize`. HIGHEST-multiplicity missing capability.
B. **NODE-CTOR / pure_ast node reflection** — 163 in the 3 parsers + 7 facade-passers and most of a 56-stub
   `string→int` class outside them. Two measured gaps: class-construction→ADT-ctor lowering (the DICT-literal path
   `_lower_irnode_construction`/`_IRNODE_CTORS` already works; the CLASS-construction path does not), and the
   concrete-sibling-call capability being gated on a RECORD return so an ADT-returning sibling degrades to an
   opaque self-dropping `val`.
C. raise-model — 40 (every CALLER of `error`/`_err`/`expect_*` inherits fall-through-on-raise).
D. string keys/attrs int-hashed (5+); E. opaque single-call delegates (5); F. tuple return / heterogeneous list
   literal (~7); G. os/tempfile/subprocess (~8); H. lambda/yield `_Unparser` (21).

### TOOL BUG found (real, repeatedly hit): bare `dict` param lowers INCONSISTENTLY
A bare `dict` parameter emits `map string (option int)` when the function is a trusted `val`, but
`map int (option int)` when it is a defined `let`. Un-trusting ANY function that calls a `dict`-taking trusted val
therefore ill-types AT THE CALL SITE. Worked around per-stub by annotating `Dict[str, PyVal]` (faithful — the why3
`--json` records are string-keyed); the emitter-side key-type disagreement should be fixed at source.
